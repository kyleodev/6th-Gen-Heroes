	<h3>Who's the smiling weirdo?</h3>
	<p>That's CJ; also known as Carl Johnson. CJ is the protaginist of the classic video game classic "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas", released for the 6th generation of consoles in 2004.
	<h4>Ok great...now why is he featured on this website?</h4>
	<p>Simple."San Andreas" is the best video game expierence I have had, in large part of CJ. The game is back in the news as one-third of the GTA: The trilogy Definitive Edition, and is reciving a lot of criticsm from fans and critics alike. I too have my gripes with the remaster, but overall am pleased with being able to relive the classic expirence of San Adnreas with today's features and improvements.
